## License
This work is dual-licensed under either ISC or MIT.

<sub>The purpose of MIT license is to avoid misinterpretation by [countries and regions that are not yet signatories to the Berne Convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention#List_of_countries_and_regions_that_are_not_signatories_to_the_Berne_Convention) while ISC license still preferred.
